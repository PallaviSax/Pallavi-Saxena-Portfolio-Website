            <p>
            Research Intern, Child’s Environmental Health & Disease Research Center (June 2023 - Aug 2023): As a Research Intern, I conducted <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UBdsiESGJ-H2q6EhcO55LpyINK6Log5HOL3JS4pqTvA/edit?usp=sharing">literature reviews</a> using PubMed to examine the associations between maternal autoimmune conditions and infections during pregnancy and infancy with subsequent psychiatric disorders. My work informed ongoing research led by Dartmouth faculty, including Dr. Hannah Laue. Additionally, I completed an epidemiology course to deepen my understanding of disease frequency, study designs, and causality, equipping me with foundational knowledge for public health research.
